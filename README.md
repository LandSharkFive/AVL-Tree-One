# AVL Self-Balancing Binary Tree (C#)

A high-performance implementation of an AVL Tree, ensuring $O(\log n)$ search, insertion, and deletion times through automatic self-balancing.

## Key Features
* **Auto-Balancing:** Uses rotations to maintain a height-balanced structure.
* **Duplicates:** Full support for duplicate value insertion.
* **Comprehensive API:** Methods for Add, Remove, Build, Clear, and Rebuild.
* **Validated:** Includes a full suite of Unit Tests to ensure structural integrity.

## Build Requirements
* Visual Studio 2022+
* .NET 6.0 / 8.0

## Educational Use
The console application demonstrates the tree's behavior by inserting random integers and visualizing the resulting balanced structure in the terminal.
